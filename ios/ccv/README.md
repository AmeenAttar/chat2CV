## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Xcode 15.0 or later
- iOS 18.0 or later
- Backend server running on `http://localhost:8000`

### Installation
1. Open `ccv.xcodeproj` in Xcode
2. Select your development team in project settings
3. Build and run the app on iOS Simulator or device

### Backend Setup
Make sure the backend server is running:
```bash
cd backend
source ../venv/bin/activate
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

## Usage

### 1. Template Selection
- Browse available resume templates with preview images
- Each template has different styling and layout options
- Select a template to start building your resume

### 2. AI Chat Interface
- Chat naturally with the AI assistant
- Describe your experience, education, skills, etc.
- The AI will automatically:
  - Determine the appropriate resume section
  - Format and structure your content
  - Provide professional phrasing
  - Suggest next steps

### 3. Resume Preview
- View your resume in real-time as you chat
- See progress indicators for each section
- Preview how your resume will look in the selected template

## Architecture

### MVVM Pattern
- **Models**: API data structures and business logic
- **Views**: SwiftUI user interface components
- **ViewModels**: Business logic and state management

### Key Components
- `TemplateSelectionView`: Template browsing and selection
- `ChatView`: AI conversation interface
- `ResumePreviewView`: Live resume preview with progress tracking
- `APIService`: Backend communication layer

### Data Flow
1. User selects template â†’ Template ID stored
2. User chats with AI â†’ Content sent to backend
3. Backend processes content â†’ Returns structured data
4. Resume preview updates automatically
5. Progress indicators reflect completion status

## API Integration

The app communicates with the backend through these endpoints:
- `GET /templates` - Get available templates
- `POST /generate-resume-section` - Generate resume content
- `GET /resume/{user_id}` - Get resume data
- `GET /resume/{user_id}/html` - Get HTML preview

## Development Notes

### Current Status
- âœ… Backend integration working
- âœ… Template system functional
- âœ… AI chat interface operational
- âœ… Resume preview with progress tracking
- âœ… Real-time updates between chat and preview

### Known Issues
- Minor deprecation warnings (non-critical)
- User ID validation requires email format
- Resume data persistence needs improvement

### Next Steps
1. Implement user authentication
2. Add voice AI integration
3. Improve resume data persistence
4. Add export functionality
5. Polish UI/UX

## Testing

The app has been tested with:
- iOS Simulator (iPhone 16)
- Backend API endpoints
- Template selection and preview
- AI chat functionality
- Resume generation and display

## Contributing

This is a single-person project focused on MVP development. The current priority is getting core functionality working before adding advanced features.

# How to Make Text Prompts Sound Truly Human (2024 Edition)

Want your AI, chatbot, or voice agent to sound like a real person—not a robot? This is your go-to, no-BS guide, packed with the latest research and real-world tricks. 

---

## 1. Why AI Still Sounds Robotic (and How to Spot It)
- **"GPT-speak" warning signs:**
  - Overly formal, academic, or stiff language ("furthermore", "however", "It is important to note...")
  - Repetitive structure (every answer feels the same)
  - Bland, generic, or hedging ("As an AI language model...")
  - Info-dense, long sentences when a short one would do
  - No personality, quirks, or opinions

**Goal:** If it sounds like a textbook, it’s wrong. If it sounds like a friend, you’re on the right track.

---

## 2. Use Conversational Language—For Real
- **Write as you’d talk to a friend:** Use contractions, slang, and everyday words.
- **Mix it up:** Vary sentence length and structure. Don’t be afraid of fragments.
- **Add small talk, transitions, and reactions:** “Hey! Ready to get started?” or “No rush, take your time.”
- **Show real empathy:** “That’s awesome!” “I totally get it.”

**Example:**
- Robotic: "Please provide your work experience."
- Human: "Let’s talk about your work! Where have you been, and what did you do there?"

## 3. Dynamic Few-Shot Prompting: Show, Don’t Just Tell
- **Give the AI examples of the tone you want.**
- **Before/After pairs:**
  - Before: "List your previous employers."
  - After: "You mentioned Google earlier—sounds impressive! Want to tell me more about what you did there?"
- **Multi-turn:**
  - User: "I worked at Google."
  - Bot: "No way, that’s huge! What kind of projects did you get to work on there?"

---

## 4. Make Prompts Context-Aware & Personal
- **Reference what the user just said.**
- **Use their name if you have it.**
- **Acknowledge progress:** “You’re crushing it! Just a couple more sections.”

---

## 5. Mirror User Sentiment & Adapt Tone
- **If the user is excited, match their energy.**
- **If they’re frustrated, show empathy:** “Ugh, that sounds annoying. Let’s fix it together.”

---

## 6. Add Humor, Playfulness, and Personality
- **Don’t be afraid to joke or be quirky:** “Resume time! Don’t worry, I left my tie at home too.”
- **Use emojis (sparingly) to add warmth:** “Let’s do this! 🚀”

---

## 7. Use "Thinking Aloud" and Controlled Imperfections
- **Narrate your reasoning:** “Hmm, let me think for a sec…”
- **Self-correct:** “Wait, scratch that—here’s a better idea.”
- **Add cognitive pauses:** “Give me a moment to check…”

---

## 8. Encourage Storytelling, Not Just Facts
- **Ask for stories:** “Can you share a story about a project you loved?”
- **Open-ended questions:** “What’s something you’re really proud of?”

---

## 9. Iterate and Refine—Prompt Makeover Lab
- **If it feels stiff, rewrite it.**
- **Ask for feedback:** “Was that too formal? Want it more playful?”
- **Try multiple versions and pick the best.**

### Prompt Makeover Lab: Real Examples
| Robotic | Human, Voice-Like |
|---------|-------------------|
| Please provide your skills. | What are you awesome at? Any skills you want to brag about? |
| Enter your education details. | Tell me about your education—any schools or degrees you’re proud of? |
| List your previous jobs. | Where have you worked before? Any job you really enjoyed? |
| Please provide your contact information. | How can I reach you if I have more questions? |
| What is your availability? | When are you usually free? (No pressure, just curious!) |
| Do you want to continue? | Should we keep going, or take a quick break? |

- **Conditional logic:** Change up your prompts based on what the user already shared.

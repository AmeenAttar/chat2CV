// Voiceflow will call these endpoints:

// 1. Get available templates
GET /templates

// 2. Generate resume section
POST /generate-resume-section
{
  "template_id": 1,
  "section_name": "personal_details",
  "raw_input": "User's conversation input",
  "user_id": "user@email.com",
  "resume_id": null
}

// 3. Get resume data
GET /resume/{user_id}

// 4. Get resume HTML preview
GET /resume/{user_id}/html?theme={template_id}
```

### **3.2 Voiceflow Webhook Configuration**
```javascript
// In Voiceflow, configure webhooks to call your backend:

// Template Selection
Webhook URL: http://localhost:8000/templates
Method: GET

// Resume Generation
Webhook URL: http://localhost:8000/generate-resume-section
Method: POST
Body: {
  "template_id": "{{template_id}}",
  "section_name": "{{section_name}}",
  "raw_input": "{{user_input}}",
  "user_id": "{{user_email}}",
  "resume_id": "{{resume_id}}"
}

// Get Resume Data
Webhook URL: http://localhost:8000/resume/{{user_email}}
Method: GET
```

## ðŸŽ¯ **Step 4: Conversation Design**

### **4.1 Welcome Flow**
```
Voiceflow: "Hi! I'm your AI resume assistant. I'll help you create a professional resume. Let's start by choosing a template. I have 16 different styles available - from professional to creative. Which style appeals to you?"

User: "I want something professional"

Voiceflow: "Great choice! I have several professional templates. Let me show you the options..."
```

### **4.2 Template Selection**
```
Voiceflow: "Here are your professional template options:
1. Classy - Clean and elegant
2. Elegant - Modern professional
3. Kendall - Traditional business
4. Executive - Senior-level focus

Which one would you like to use?"

User: "I'll go with Classy"

Voiceflow: "Perfect! The Classy template is excellent for professional roles. Now let's start building your resume. What's your full name?"
```

### **4.3 Information Collection**
```
Voiceflow: "What's your full name?"

User: "John Doe"

Voiceflow: "Nice to meet you, John! What's your email address?"

User: "john.doe@email.com"

Voiceflow: "Great! Now, tell me about your professional background. What's your current job title or the position you're targeting?"

User: "I'm a Senior Software Engineer"

Voiceflow: "Excellent! Senior Software Engineer. Now, let's talk about your work experience. Where are you currently working?"
```

## ðŸ”§ **Step 5: Error Handling**

### **5.1 Conversation Recovery**
```
User: "I don't understand"

Voiceflow: "No worries! Let me explain this differently. We're building your resume step by step. Right now, I need to know where you work. You can say something like 'I work at Google' or 'I'm currently at Microsoft'."

User: "I work at Google"

Voiceflow: "Perfect! Google. What's your job title there?"
```

### **5.2 Data Validation**
```
User: "My email is not-an-email"

Voiceflow: "I need a valid email address for your resume. Could you please provide your email in the format: yourname@company.com?"

User: "john.doe@gmail.com"

Voiceflow: "Thank you! john.doe@gmail.com is perfect."
```

## ðŸ“± **Step 6: iOS Integration**

### **6.1 Voiceflow SDK Integration**
```swift
// In your iOS app, integrate Voiceflow SDK
import Voiceflow

class VoiceflowManager {
    private let voiceflowClient: VoiceflowClient
    
    init() {
        voiceflowClient = VoiceflowClient(apiKey: "your-voiceflow-api-key")
    }
    
    func startConversation() {
        voiceflowClient.startConversation { result in
            switch result {
            case .success(let response):
                // Handle Voiceflow response
                self.handleVoiceflowResponse(response)
            case .failure(let error):
                // Handle error
                print("Voiceflow error: \(error)")
            }
        }
    }
    
    private func handleVoiceflowResponse(_ response: VoiceflowResponse) {
        // Process Voiceflow response and update UI
        // Send data to backend when needed
    }
}
```

### **6.2 Update iOS App Architecture**
